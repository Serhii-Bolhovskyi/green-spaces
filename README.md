## Features

### Contact Form Validation and Submission

This project includes a robust contact form with the following features:

1. **Dynamic Contact Number Generation**:
    - A unique contact number is generated each time the form is used. This number is included in the form submission to ensure each email has a unique identifier.

2. **EmailJS Integration**:
    - The form is integrated with [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/) to facilitate the sending of contact form submissions directly to an email account. This integration uses the EmailJS service to handle form data and send it securely.

3. **Form Validation**:
    - The form includes comprehensive validation checks for:
        - **Name Field**: Ensures the name is not empty.
        - **Email Field**: Ensures the email is not empty and follows a valid email format.
        - **Message Field**: Ensures the message is not empty.
    - Validation feedback is provided to users in real-time, highlighting fields that require attention with error messages and visual cues.

4. **Success and Error Handling**:
    - Visual feedback is provided to users upon successful form submission through a toast notification system.
    - Errors during form submission are logged to the console for debugging purposes.

5. **Toast Notification**:
    - A toast notification is displayed to confirm successful form submission. The notification automatically hides after a few seconds, but users can manually dismiss it by clicking a close icon.

6. **Input Validation Feedback**:
    - Inputs are visually marked as valid or invalid based on the validation results.
    - Error messages are displayed next to invalid inputs to guide the user on what needs to be corrected.
